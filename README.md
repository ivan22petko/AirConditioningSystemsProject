# AirConditioningSystemsProject
This project aims to analyze the air conditioning system of the Airbus A350, a modern long-haul commercial aircraft, focusing on its components, operating principles, and thermal performance.

Subsequently, the aircraftâ€™s air conditioning system will be compared to a traditional HVAC system used in buildings, highlighting the main differences in design, operation, and constraints.

In the project notebook `airplane_ECS_modelling.py` are used the functions `psychro` and `airplane_ECS_modelling`.
